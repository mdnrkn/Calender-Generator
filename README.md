# Calender Generator

## Overview

Calendar Generator is a C++ application designed to generate calendars for specific years. This program not only generates a calendar for the inputted year but also handles leap years. Additionally, it provides users with the option to save the generated calendar in a `.txt` file format for future reference.

## Features

- **Yearly Calendar Generation :** The program generates a calendar for the inputted year, displaying all the months and days of the year.
- **Leap Year Handling :** The application correctly maintains leap years, ensuring accurate calendar generation for both regular and leap years.
- **File Saving Option :** After generating the calendar, the user is prompted to save the generated file.
- **Automatic Naming :** The saved files are named in the format `'calendar_[year].txt'`, making it easy to identify and organize the generated calendars.

## How to Use

- **Input Year :** Run the program and input the desired year for which you want to generate the calendar.
- **View Calendar :** The program will display the calendar for the specified year.
- **Save Calendar (Optional) :** After viewing the calendar, the program will prompt you with a message asking if you want to save the generated calendar. Type 'y' or 'Y' for yes.
- **Check Saved File :** A `.txt` file named `'calendar_[year].txt'` will be created in the same directory where the program is located.

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler :** Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system to compile and run the program.
